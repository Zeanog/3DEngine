# 3DEngine
Just a really rough engine.  Mostly low level code.  

I have been working on this slowly over a couple of years.  I found a demo (https://lnkd.in/gw6GtmZ) to learn from.

I've also been using this to tryout various ideas in C++ I've had, like a foreach loop.  So some of the code is inefficient.  But I hope somewhat clever.  :D

I used Visual Studio 2019 for the IDE.
